Timeseries Prediction

TODO: TABLE with Python and package Versions!

Task: Given a set of sensor data for multiple streams, e.g. temperature, power consumption. The goal is to predict the future values of these signals, optimally including a confidence range.

Approach: Take the stream of data and remove the last ~10% of the data. Build a prediction algorithm that is able to predict the future values of the streams as accurately as possible and compare against the values you removed.

    Data Set:
    - Powersupply Stream
      Use the power supply stream from the same data source: Stream Data Mining Repository. Here the challenge is to integrate seasonality into the analysis.

Advanced: Investigate your prediction algorithm and try to determine under which (controlled) circumstances it makes correct predictions.
